# Enhanced AI Brief Builder - Argument-First Workflow

## üéØ Strategic Approach: Arguments First, Administrative Second

The enhanced workflow prioritizes **core legal arguments** over administrative sections, ensuring maximum impact and strategic coherence.

## üìã 4-Phase Enhanced Workflow

### Phase 1: Case Setup
- **Upload strategy session recordings** (AI transcribes and extracts case info)
- **Complete basic case information** (parties, legal issues, precedents)
- **Establish foundation** for strategic planning

### Phase 2: Document Selection & Analysis
- **Select relevant documents** from past cases, research, or legal materials
- **Explain relevance** to current case
- **AI analyzes documents** for key insights and legal principles
- **Build knowledge base** for strategic outline development

### Phase 3: Strategic Case Outline Brainstorming
- **AI creates comprehensive outline** based on documents and case info
- **Prioritizes arguments** by impact and strategic importance
- **Review and refine** strategic approach
- **Plan section structure** with argument focus

### Phase 4: Argument Development (Arguments First!)
- **Build core legal arguments** based on strategic outline
- **Start with highest priority arguments** (constitutional, statutory, policy)
- **Focus on high-impact sections** that win cases
- **Administrative sections** (Interest of Amicus) come last

## üèóÔ∏è Argument-First Section Priority

### High Priority (Build First)
1. **Primary Constitutional Argument** - Core constitutional analysis
2. **Secondary Legal Arguments** - Supporting legal theories
3. **Summary of Argument** - Synthesize the arguments

### Medium Priority (Build Second)
4. **Interest of Amicus Curiae** - Administrative requirements
5. **Conclusion** - Final synthesis and relief request
