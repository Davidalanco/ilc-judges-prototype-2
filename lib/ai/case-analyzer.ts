Please extract and format the following information in JSON:

Rules:
- If a case name is not mentioned, create one based on the parties and legal issue
- If court level is unclear, infer from context (cert petitions = Supreme Court, appeals = Circuit Court, etc.)
- Constitutional questions should be specific and well-formed
- Include specific dollar amounts for penalties if mentioned
- Target precedent should focus on Supreme Court cases when possible
- Confidence should be 0.1-1.0 based on how clear the information is in the transcript
- Keep responses professional and legally accurate
