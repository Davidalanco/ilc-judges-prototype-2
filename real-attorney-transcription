00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:13,920 [Speaker 0]
Okay, so we have the, the Miller brief possibility to help First, First Liberty out, and that case involves, um, Amish in the state of New York 

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,500 [Speaker 0]
who, 

00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,520 [Speaker 0]
um, lost at the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The State of New York said 

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:58,859 [Speaker 0]
that, well, they ended up changing their law with regards to vaccination for schoolchildren, and they're allowing the medical exemption to continue for vaccinations, but they won't give an exemption anymore for religious reasons. They called the religious reason garbage, and i- i- the Amish still did not vaccinate their kids. And so, various, um, Amish schools or schools serving plain people out there are being prosecuted and being fined. I, I can't remember, are the Amish families being fined as well? Do you know? 

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,959 [Speaker 1]
I don't know if it was the families or- 

00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:01,359 [Speaker 2]
It was against the schools 

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:01,879 [Speaker 1]
... if it was just the schools. 

00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:02,579 [Speaker 0]
It's against the schools. 

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,319 [Speaker 2]
118,000 penalties against the schools. 

00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:16,699 [Speaker 0]
Okay. An- and really, if, if you go against the schools, you're going against the families because these are, uh, these are very small institutions th- that, that are being run by, 

00:01:16,699 --> 00:01:21,099 [Speaker 0]
uh, by, um, church districts basically. So 

00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:43,019 [Speaker 0]
i- and if they can't educate their kids there, that's gonna be a, that's gonna be a big threat to the Amish on the order of, uh, Wisconsin versus Yoder. So, so the issue is free exercise of religion, and we have First Liberty asking for briefs on various topics. 

00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,759 [Speaker 1]
This case might be one where 

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:54,959 [Speaker 1]
the, the Smith decision, um, dealing with generally neu- uh, neutrally applicable laws come up to, come into play. 

00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,359 [Speaker 0]
Ne- neutral and generally applicable. 

00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:11,419 [Speaker 1]
Neutral and generally applicable. And some Supreme Court justices have previously, uh, voiced their opinion that the Smith decision should be overruled. Um, my concern is that 

00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:19,399 [Speaker 1]
because this case deals with vaccines, even... A- and the good thing is, it doesn't deal with the COVID vaccine, which is even more political, but because it deals with vaccines- 

00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,899 [Speaker 0]
And because COVID was political. 

00:02:20,899 --> 00:03:00,319 [Speaker 1]
And because COVID was political, there may be, uh, less of a, uh, desire on, on the part of the majority of justices to deal with this issue. The more liberal judges might not want to deal with this case because they like what the lower court ruled, that the fine should stand against the Amish community. There may be conservatives who believe that this isn't a, a nice case to deal with the issue because it might not be sympathetic, even amongst some conservatives who are very pro-vaccine. And so, even though the legal issue itself might be clean, uh, the political, the political nature of vaccines might make it a difficult topic. 

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:34,959 [Speaker 0]
And, and the other downside... I think there's lots of upsides for this case, but the other downside is a court could deal with this on the neutral and generally applicable front, uh, where they could just... They could apply strict scrutiny without overturning Smith, um, because they will give an exemption for, for medical, but they won't give it for religion. That means that it, that it's not generally applicable, and that's where you can still get the, the strict scrutiny. And the fact that... 

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:57,379 [Speaker 0]
I, I, I'm wondering in the back of my head whether you can even make an argument that it's, that it's not neutral because they took, they specifically took away the religious exemption. It's not as if they had some general law and they were never dealing with the issue. They, they ended up targeting religion, and there's some history there. But, but it could be a good vehicle because 

00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,699 [Speaker 0]
Amish, Plain Mennonites, 

00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,459 [Speaker 0]
um, 

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:12,859 [Speaker 0]
Orthodox Jews, they, they always make good plaintiffs in these cases. The, the optics tends to b- tend to be better. And, 

00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:19,199 [Speaker 0]
and I think there's, I think there's an angle here that could be useful for us, 

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:28,819 [Speaker 0]
uh, based on the history of, of religious liberty, which is something we know a little bit about. And the fact that we're here in Pennsylvania is pretty cool because, 

00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:39,179 [Speaker 0]
uh, religious liberty kind of grew out of the Pennsylvania experience as... I- in contrast to the other colonies. And if, if we're talking about 

00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:44,799 [Speaker 0]
the colonial experience where they used to target, 

00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:51,519 [Speaker 0]
um, religion, uh, in a, in a few different ways. One was 

00:04:51,519 --> 00:05:27,999 [Speaker 0]
Mennonites and Quakers couldn't swear oaths, and that made it very hard for them to put on a defense or even go to court for claims they needed. So, that was a big religious liberty concern early on. Um, the church taxation. So, folks who didn't feel like they could support the state church, that was a big problem. And then conscientious objection from, from warfare became a big issue. And I, I think if we talk about the history there, why it matters, talk about, um, Madison and Memorial and Remonstrance, where he's talking about the, 

00:05:27,999 --> 00:06:00,399 [Speaker 0]
i- the homage that we owe to two sovereigns, not just one, and the, and the civil magistrate shouldn't unnecessarily create these conflicts with the Sovereign of the Universe. And that, that there are certain groups of people, it's not an issue of, can you just get them to comply, but what do you do when they don't? And that's, that's what you're dealing with here in the Amish. They're, they're just not gonna comply. Um, I think, I think that makes it more sympathetic. Like, what do we do as a... 

00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:14,315 [Speaker 0]
E- explaining to the court that we need a, a pressure relief valve-... because if they continue to go to war against the Amish, the Amish aren't gonna change. And so you, you need a way, uh, to, 

00:06:14,315 --> 00:06:18,535 [Speaker 0]
f- for there to be a stand-down on this. Um, 

00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:23,995 [Speaker 0]
and that the issues that at issue here, 

00:06:23,995 --> 00:06:29,955 [Speaker 0]
um, I know you put it this way earlier, Jeremy, y- you compare the 

00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:44,855 [Speaker 0]
burden to government by people saying, "No, I'm not going to go to war," during wartime is a whole lot more of an existential threat to the government and to the community than vaccines. 

00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:45,495 [Speaker 0]
Um- 

00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:57,595 [Speaker 2]
And what makes the optics so good here is, is they're so contained. I mean, the Amish schools are located on Amish land, they serve the Amish, they're supported by the Amish. 

00:06:57,595 --> 00:07:00,495 [Speaker 2]
Uh, they're, they keep to themselves. 

00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:05,375 [Speaker 0]
Th- they do. And, and so it's, it's an insular community 

00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:09,395 [Speaker 0]
that wants to just continue to do their own thing, on their own land with their own people. 

00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:21,115 [Speaker 2]
Live according to their own faith which is, from what I understand, universally against vaccinations. So there's no, th- there's not an arbitrary choice here. They're against vaccination, period. 

00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:23,575 [Speaker 0]
Right. 

00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:38,815 [Speaker 3]
I, I think it might also be helpful to remind the court too that when in the colonial period, they were giving more liberal accommodations to religious liberty. It resulted in an unintended consequence of peace and prosperity because- 

00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:39,315 [Speaker 0]
[laughs] 

00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:44,355 [Speaker 3]
... it attracted so many people to, to Pennsylvania but also to America. 

00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:45,235 [Speaker 0]
The, I, I, I- 

00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:45,295 [Speaker 3]
For us 

00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:48,335 [Speaker 0]
... like the way you put that. The on intended- 

00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:48,355 [Speaker 3]
On a- 

00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:52,895 [Speaker 0]
... unintended consequence of peace and prosperity. But, but it's true when you give people liberty- 

00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:54,215 [Speaker 3]
Yeah. 

00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:55,175 [Speaker 3]
Right. Exactly. 

00:07:55,175 --> 00:08:01,135 [Speaker 0]
Oth- other good things happen. And when you take away people's liberty, other bad things happen. 

00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:15,155 [Speaker 0]
And, and, and I think we miss that, that part, that, that our liberties, our liberties go arm in arm. And so if, if you end up burdening free exercise of religion, 

00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:43,175 [Speaker 0]
i- eh, what kind of protection to your freedom of speech and assembly and the other rights? Because if government can force you to violate your most deeply held convictions, eh, that, that is more of a threat to, to human independence than freedom of speech. So if, if you don't have the firewall, it just breaks down our other constitutional rights. And if you break down those other constitutional rights, you don't have, you don't have the freedom 

00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:51,995 [Speaker 0]
for the kind of creativity that it takes for a capitalist system like ours to work, to bring the peace and prosperity. So I really like that angle, Lauren. 

00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:55,775 [Speaker 0]
And, and it's broad enough that it could appeal to... 

00:08:55,775 --> 00:09:02,435 [Speaker 0]
I- it could appeal across the board rather than simply to th- the 

00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:09,375 [Speaker 0]
four or five in my mind who are most likely to think, "Oh, we finally have an opportunity to overturn Smith." 

00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,015 [Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm. 

00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:20,995 [Speaker 0]
Um, I, I'm thinking that, that Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas are immediately thinking, "Hey, let's, let's get at Smith." But, 

00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:21,915 [Speaker 0]
um... 

00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:36,735 [Speaker 1]
There may be some level of discussing the difference between the type of religious liberty that we expect from the government when we want to do something, when we wanna actively do something to comply with our religious beliefs- 

00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:36,835 [Speaker 0]
Oh, yes 

00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:40,615 [Speaker 1]
... versus here the government is trying to force- 

00:09:40,615 --> 00:09:42,275 [Speaker 0]
Force them to do something. 

00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:57,595 [Speaker 1]
Yes. To force an action. And even more, uh, what may be appealing to the, the more left-leaning judges, they're trying to put something into their body so there may be bodily autonomy arguments that the, the left would be sympathetic to. 

00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:58,775 [Speaker 0]
That, that's really interesting. 

00:09:58,775 --> 00:09:59,495 [Speaker 3]
Yeah. Yeah. 

00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:21,875 [Speaker 0]
I, I think, I think it's true because one of, one of the pieces to religious liberty that I think gives people the most qualms, most qualms are, you just wanna do your own thing and be able to get your way and so you're using religious liberty as an excuse. But that's less of an issue when you're trying to abstain from something. I think it's more of an issue when you now, government, you now need to do this for me. 

00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,795 [Speaker 3]
Mm-hmm. 

00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:45,175 [Speaker 1]
And so that's where we can go back to that analogy between in the beginning of our country saying, "You want to abstain from picking up a weapon and committing an act of violence during war." Now, the existential threat or the impact on the rest of the country was now other people are going to have to pick up arms. Maybe younger- 

00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:45,375 [Speaker 0]
In your place 

00:10:45,375 --> 00:11:04,175 [Speaker 1]
... people than otherwise might have to. Uh, more of our neighbors are going to have to, uh, to pick up arms and fight. And, there's a negative impact that if we don't have enough people, we may lose our country because another country takes it over. That's less of an impact than 

00:11:04,175 --> 00:11:16,035 [Speaker 1]
there may be a outbreak of a disease, especially in this day and age with the way that medical care can respond to those types of things. 

00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:21,735 [Speaker 0]
And, and the Supreme, [phone ringing] the Supreme Court can actually dodge the question 

00:11:21,735 --> 00:11:24,795 [Speaker 0]
i- in some sense of 

00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:29,015 [Speaker 0]
w- what is the relative value of vaccines- 

00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:29,055 [Speaker 1]
Yeah 

00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,835 [Speaker 0]
... versus the religious freedom. 

00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:33,015 [Speaker 0]
Is, is- 

00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:33,035 [Speaker 1]
Yeah, we're, we're 

00:11:33,035 --> 00:11:42,395 [Speaker 0]
... because I think what the Supreme Court would end up doing is imposing strict scrutiny. And then they're gonna send it back to the Second Circuit. 

00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:43,515 [Speaker 1]
Okay. Yeah, we'll talk about it. 

00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:43,715 [Speaker 0]
Um. 

00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:45,415 [Speaker 2]
Without dealing with Smith? 

00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:47,155 [Speaker 1]
After. Okay. All right. Bye. 

00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:48,715 [Speaker 0]
No. No. Dealing with- 

00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:48,775 [Speaker 2]
Dealing with- 

00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:49,895 [Speaker 0]
Dealing with Smith. 

00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:50,415 [Speaker 2]
Okay. 

00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:52,335 [Speaker 0]
Then imposing strict scrutiny and saying- 

00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:52,555 [Speaker 2]
Okay. Because- 

00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:53,555 [Speaker 0]
... in light of this- 

00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:54,335 [Speaker 2]
Okay. 

00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:54,855 [Speaker 0]
Now- 

00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:55,175 [Speaker 2]
All right. So- 

00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:58,575 [Speaker 0]
... take a look and see how much of a risk is there if- 

00:11:58,575 --> 00:11:58,855 [Speaker 2]
Okay 

00:11:58,855 --> 00:12:01,555 [Speaker 0]
... if these kids aren't getting 

00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:03,355 [Speaker 0]
chicken pox vaccine. 

00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,995 [Speaker 2]
Do you think that that's more likely? Do you think that's more likely than...

00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:08,967 [Speaker 0]
It tends to be their minimalist approach. 

00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:09,387 [Speaker 4]
Right. 

00:12:09,387 --> 00:12:11,308 [Speaker 0]
And it's more likely they're gonna get- 

00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:11,327 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm 

00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:13,288 [Speaker 0]
... more members of the court. And so- 

00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:13,407 [Speaker 4]
Right 

00:12:13,407 --> 00:12:15,648 [Speaker 0]
... e- even as we're talking about our- 

00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:15,747 [Speaker 4]
Yeah 

00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:20,007 [Speaker 0]
... o- ourselves, to be using language that 

00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:23,187 [Speaker 0]
maybe resonates with the left a little bit- 

00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:23,387 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm 

00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:25,148 [Speaker 0]
... um, 

00:12:25,148 --> 00:12:30,867 [Speaker 0]
minority religions, uh, uh, the right to, to chart your own course, 

00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:33,267 [Speaker 0]
I, I kind of- 

00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:33,287 [Speaker 4]
Grieves me. 

00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:37,827 [Speaker 0]
I kind of hate quoting Kennedy's "life, the universe and everything" quote- 

00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:38,648 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm 

00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:40,447 [Speaker 0]
... but it's, but it sort of fits in that theme- 

00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:40,467 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm 

00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:48,008 [Speaker 0]
... of if, if people can chart these things out, although I don't know if that's good law anymore 'cause it came from Casey. 

00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:49,467 [Speaker 4]
I wouldn't point to that case. 

00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:51,207 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. [laughs] 

00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:52,627 [Speaker 4]
I think, yeah, Casey- 

00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:52,648 [Speaker 0]
It really- 

00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:56,308 [Speaker 4]
... is bad law and I think the reason upon which it was based is bad as well. 

00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,927 [Speaker 0]
[laughs] Kennedy's, Kennedy's logic there. 

00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:02,727 [Speaker 4]
Yeah. 

00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:05,067 [Speaker 4]
Okay. 

00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,747 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Anything we should add to that? 

00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:23,007 [Speaker 4]
Well, I'm, uh, I mean, it, still what intrigues me is what argument is most likely to succeed in getting this case before the Court, um, considering the three justices that are going to be most wary of its impact on the broader- 

00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:23,227 [Speaker 0]
Yeah 

00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:28,367 [Speaker 4]
... civil rights area. I mean, I think that'll be the biggest deterrent from 

00:13:28,367 --> 00:13:36,087 [Speaker 4]
taking the case. Isn't it really the, the sixth though? So instead of focusing on the ones that are 

00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:39,307 [Speaker 4]
most likely to vote no for lots of reasons- 

00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:39,347 [Speaker 0]
Uh- 

00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:41,347 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm, that's true. It's the sixth that are going- 

00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:41,727 [Speaker 0]
But- 

00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:41,747 [Speaker 4]
To be 

00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:55,467 [Speaker 0]
... but you want the first impression even for the ones who are less likely to vote for cert. You want their first impression on this issue to be one where there's, where there's a gener- general benefit to everyone- 

00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,147 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm 

00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,387 [Speaker 0]
... for having rights protected. 

00:13:58,387 --> 00:13:58,887 [Speaker 4]
Where people on both sides- 

00:13:58,887 --> 00:14:00,527 [Speaker 0]
Rather than general risk for everyone. 

00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:02,547 [Speaker 4]
And, and not, and not perceived as a threat. 

00:14:02,547 --> 00:14:02,667 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. 

00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:14,407 [Speaker 4]
Right, so people on both sides of the political spectrum should be able to, um, agree even if they disagree on the substance of whether somebody should take vac- a vaccine or not- 

00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:14,427 [Speaker 0]
Yes 

00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:16,567 [Speaker 4]
... they should be able to agree that this principle is important. 

00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:20,107 [Speaker 0]
That strict scrutiny is important because the principle of freedom is important and- 

00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:20,147 [Speaker 4]
Right 

00:14:20,147 --> 00:14:22,347 [Speaker 0]
... which is why 

00:14:22,347 --> 00:14:27,027 [Speaker 0]
when the Employment Division versus Smith 

00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:37,147 [Speaker 0]
it was decided that Congress, I think almost unanimously, passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. And that was supported, 

00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:42,987 [Speaker 0]
uh, that was supported by the left and the right and was signed into law by- 

00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:44,327 [Speaker 4]
Doklan? 

00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:45,627 [Speaker 0]
Yes. [laughs] 

00:14:45,627 --> 00:14:46,367 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm. 

00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:47,787 [Speaker 0]
So- 

00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:47,947 [Speaker 4]
Right 

00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:54,827 [Speaker 0]
... it's... Our, our core pin- principles aren't Republican or Democrat 

00:14:54,827 --> 00:15:10,607 [Speaker 0]
and so there ought to be ways to talk about that, that are going to make sense to everyone. Because you're, you're right, it's not like, it's not like we need to convince them of the case right now but we kind of do, even though it's asking them to take the case as their first impression. Um- 

00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:22,007 [Speaker 4]
Do we know that the second, did the Second Circuit make a decision under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act saying that it, it doesn't violate some... I don't think so. I- 

00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:24,147 [Speaker 0]
No, because it was state action. 

00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:24,447 [Speaker 4]
So- 

00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:27,487 [Speaker 0]
RFRA doesn't, doesn't apply to state action. 

00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:35,907 [Speaker 4]
Okay. And so if New York doesn't have a Religious Freedom Restoration Act, they dealt with it under rational basis? 

00:15:35,907 --> 00:15:41,547 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. I think, I think they dealt with it under rational basis and did not consider it to be... 

00:15:41,547 --> 00:15:48,527 [Speaker 0]
I think they consider it to be neutral and generally applicable and then applied Smith and simply applied rational basis. 

00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:49,467 [Speaker 4]
Okay. That's what I recall. 

00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,147 [Speaker 0]
Although I haven't, I haven't read the decision. 

00:15:51,147 --> 00:15:56,607 [Speaker 4]
That's what our, I did, I did glance at it. I had it up but I, that's what I recall. 

00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,247 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:04,587 [Speaker 4]
So we'll have to determine whether New York has a Religious Freedom Restoration Act at all, if that's relevant to what we're doing. 

00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:09,247 [Speaker 0]
I, well, I, I don't think we, I don't think we need to because the appeal to the Supreme Court wouldn't- 

00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:09,627 [Speaker 4]
Right, it's basically- 

00:16:09,627 --> 00:16:15,647 [Speaker 0]
... be whether they made a wrong decision under state law. It w- it would be 

00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:23,367 [Speaker 0]
nicely dealing with the First Amendment issue because the fir- i- i- we, we run into this all the time too where we've got a state- 

00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:27,367 [Speaker 4]
It was a simple claim. Yeah. Violation of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, that was the only claim. 

00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:28,627 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:30,407 [Speaker 4]
So. 

00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,147 [Speaker 0]
So it's- 

00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:31,327 [Speaker 4]
So it's no, 

00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:31,327 [Speaker 3]
No 

00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:34,887 [Speaker 0]
... it's the First A- First Amendment free exercise right applied to the states- 

00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:34,927 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm 

00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:35,927 [Speaker 0]
... through the Fourteenth Amendment. 

00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:36,587 [Speaker 4]
Mm-hmm. 

00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:38,267 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:43,227 [Speaker 4]
Oh, and it says Second Circuit applied a rational basis review under Smith and affirmed, so yes. 

00:16:43,227 --> 00:16:43,567 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,287 [Speaker 4]
That's what it said. 

00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,567 [Speaker 0]
Cliff notes. 

00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:51,567 [Speaker 4]
Updates. Yes. New York does not have an explicitly named Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 

00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:56,007 [Speaker 0]
Okay. 

00:16:56,007 --> 00:17:00,867 [Speaker 0]
All right. Anything more for the good of the order? 

00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:03,347 [Speaker 3]
No, I'm excited to see what, what happens. 

00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:05,507 [Speaker 0]
Yeah. Yeah. Me too.
